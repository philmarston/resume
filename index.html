    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>I live by the creed 'Stay Curious', which means I am interested in and have a broad knowledge in a vast array of different domains. This gives me flexibility to fit in to a range of environments using a variety of tools quite easily. I'm particularly interested in using VR|AR|XR, biosensing, learning analytics and AI to create user experiences that can develop user skills and abilities applicable beyond the user-interface.</p>
